# 30DaysObjc

## Hello open source community

I'm Kuan-Wei. I don't have any computer sicence degree nor related background but becoming an iOS engineer after learning how to code in one year.
I only have the entry level of iOS coding skill and still want to learn more and share more. That's why I'm sharing this project to the community.

Althought Swift is hot right now and I learned Swift in the beginning when I start to learn coding. However, after I start to work as an iOS engineer, most of the projects are still written in Objective-C and they need to be maintained. So Objective-C is equally important for people like me and I want to write Objective-C code as many as possible.

I have seen a lot of great works and inspired by [allenwong's 30DaysofSwift](https://github.com/allenwong/30DaysofSwift), so I would like to do a similiar project called 30DaysObjc.
